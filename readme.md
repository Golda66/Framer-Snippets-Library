# Framer Snippets

*I built this library to compliment the included snippets library in Framer. These snippets focus on repeated actions and include as little code as possible. It should be quite helpful to beginners who are learning the basic behaviors of Framer, but it should be also be helpful to more experienced users when used as shortcuts.*

To use - drag the folders into your Framer snippets folder on your local machine:
In Framer, go to snippets > show snippets folder
Drag all of my folders into that folder. See my YouTube channel for a few demos:

### Trigger On End

Included are two ways to trigger an animation on the end of another animation. The formal one should be used when you intend on reusing the animations, the casual one can be used for one off triggering.

### Repeating

This will allow you view your prototypes in slow motion to more finely tune your animations.
